# ClassificationTool
The classification tool developed for Navigating Complexity course.


`FaceBookCommands.swift`contains the source code for how we clissified the Facebook comments.
It is a part of another project found [here](https://github.com/SwiftRecipes/main-repository)

This repository is only made to provide easy access to the source code.

If you want to run the code, I recommend going to the above mentioned repositoy.
It relies on Swift 2.2 and the Foundation framework, so it only works on Mac OS.
